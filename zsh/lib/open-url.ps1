<#
    Open a URL in a browser window on the virtual desktop currently in view.

    Windows hands a URL to the already running browser, which opens it in
    whichever of its windows was last active -- on whatever virtual desktop that
    window sits. So the tab either lands out of sight, or Windows drags the view
    over to the other desktop to follow it.

    A browser reaches for its last active window, and activating one is all it
    takes to make it that. So: raise a window that is already on this desktop,
    then hand over the URL. With no window here to raise, open a new one, which
    Windows always places on the desktop in view.

    Exits non-zero when it cannot do better than the shell would -- unknown
    scheme, or a browser it has no window flag for -- so the caller can fall
    back to the plain handler.
