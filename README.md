Yann Lugrin's dotfiles
===================

Requirements
------------

Homebrew installed:

    ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

Git installed:

    brew install git zsh

Add homebrew zsh path to list of shell:

    echo $(which zsh) | sudo tee -a /etc/shells

Set zsh as your login shell:

    chsh -s $(which zsh)

Install
-------

Clone onto your laptop:

    cd ~; git clone https://github.com/yannlugrin/dotfiles.git .dotfiles

Install [rcm](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm) and others dependencies
like `vim` and more:

    sh ~/.dotfiles/Brewfile

Install:

    rcup -d .dotfiles -x README.md -x LICENSE -x Brewfile -x bin

This will create symlinks for config files in your home directory. The `-x`
options, which exclude the `README.md`, `LICENSE`, and `Brewfile` files plus
`bin` directory, are needed during installation but can be skipped once the
`.rcrc` configuration file is symlinked in.

You can safely run `rcup` multiple times to update:

    rcup

If you use iTerm, I recommand solarized color scheme (same used in my Vim
config): http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized.

More informations about my config

Coming soon (or maybe later).
